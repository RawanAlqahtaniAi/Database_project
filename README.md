# Database_project

During the Covid-19 pandemic and the
suspension of travel, cinemas and cafes, these
were the first destinations for entertainment
and were closed, so interest in movement and
outdoor activities became more, but there is no
database saves user and activities data.
Our database system aims to serve the largest
possible segment of those looking for a
destination full of various activities.
